      <!-- Gemini 3 I asked: I have a picture on my website of the Moon can you please give me a brief description of the celestial body of MOON and the Earth-Moon navigation? make it sciencey? Thank you. -->
      <p>The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite, a differentiated rocky body characterized by a surface of anorthositic crust and basaltic maria. It is in synchronous rotation with Earth, resulting in a persistent near-side alignment due to tidal locking. Its surface is covered in fine-grained regolith, generated by eons of micrometeoroid bombardment in the absence of a significant atmosphere.</p>
